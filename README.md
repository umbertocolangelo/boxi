A Flutter application prototype developed for the "E-Business and Entrepreneurship" course at Berliner Hochschule f√ºr Technik (BHT). The app allows users to book smart locker services for secure storage of personal belongings and features an innovative delivery option to transfer items between locker points across the city. Leveraging Firebase for real-time database management and Google Maps API for dynamic visualization of service locations, the app offers a seamless and interactive user experience.
